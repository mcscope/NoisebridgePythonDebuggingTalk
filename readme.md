# Python Debugging with PUDB, Charles, and cProfile
## aka ARG! WHY ARENâ€™T YOU WORKING????

These are the files associated with a talk I gave to Noisebridge Python Class on May 8, 2017
[Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/noisebridge/events/238947420/)


There is a presentation, and some sample code for you to use the debugging tools on. The sample code is an integration with the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#section/Studio-Ghibli-API)
