# Python Debugging with PUDB, Charles, and cProfile
## aka ARG! WHY AREN’T YOU WORKING????

These are the files associated with a talk I gave to Noisebridge Python Class on May 8, 2017
[Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/noisebridge/events/238947420/)

The slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MoblSzxReiI288fyCKJ216KCjRpUjRIa_28iqHmCXtc/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000), and as the PPTX in this file.
The slideshow has better formatting than the pptx.
